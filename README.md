Neural Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System over MovieLens Dataset.

## Modern Days Recommender System
Widely used in majority of real-world domains, ranging from entertainment and ecommerce to even dating apps.

Why is high-quality recommender system important?
1. Personalised user experience
2. Build long-term trust and loyalty

Challenges in developing one:
- Time-consuming
- Cold Start Problem
- Customer Expectations
- Lack thereof Explicit Feedback

- Change the target outcome from the rating to positive implicit feedback
- Add negative sampling

## Model Evaluation
- Some evaluation methods: 
  - Accuracy (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ) â€“ how accurately predict user opinions over items.
- For Recommendation System:
  - NOT interested in predicting the actual ratings of these movies in Recommendation System.
  - Interested in predicting that the user WILL INTERACT with these movies eventually.

### Hit Ratio @ 10
- Pick one recent item we know the user DID interact with; we call this item as our Target.
- We add 99 random samples and the Target to the pool.
- Use NCF model to find the probability in which the user WILL INTERACT with all 100 samples, and sort them - from highest to lowest - based on that probability.
- If the Target is properly placed among the Top 10 probabilities in which the user WILL INTERACT with, we get one hit rate.
- Repeat the same process for all 943 users, and see how many hit rates we can get out of the total.

- 61.82% of users that are recommended the actual item, (among a list of 10 items) that they eventually interact with.
